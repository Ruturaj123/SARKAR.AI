# SARKAR.AI
We built this WebApp in CodeShastra 5.0 - Round 0.

Everyone has the curiosity to know which party will be ruling India from 2019 onwards. The application, given a trending topic as input, offers in-depth insights on other people's perspectives on these topics from various news articles, blogs, and Twitter. By having a look at all the analysis, we hope that you will be able to decide on choosing your party. We didn't predict which party will win as then our application will be considered biased, and now our app says what people say. We also have provided you with a bot where you can feed it some context and then asked questions based on that.

### Here is how the WebApp looks:

### Dashboard where you can search the topic you want analysis on:
